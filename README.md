# Trump Signs Executive Order Promoting Artificial Intelligence

This article talks about how President trump recently signed an executive order that would spur US investment in promoting more research and development around artificial intelligence, an issue that has been brought up in the past to federal administration but was never really seriously considered until now. I found this article interesting because a main reason implied here for the enactment of this new legislation, is trump's fear of the US falling significantly behind other nations (China specifically) within the AI and technology industries. This proves slightly ironic, as a contributing factor to the rise in international competition stems from big tech corporations like Google and Microsoft, expanding their operations into more Asian and European countries, as members from these companies have cited their concerns of working with the US government over potential security and ethical conflicts.
