## Trump Signs Executive Order Promoting Artificial Intelligence

This article talks about how President trump recently signed an executive order that would spur US investment in promoting more research and development around artificial intelligence, an issue that has been brought up in the past to federal administration but was never really seriously considered until now. I found this article interesting because a main reason implied here for the enactment of this new legislation, is trump's fear of the US falling significantly behind other nations (China specifically) within the AI and technology industries. This proves slightly ironic, as a contributing factor to the rise in international competition stems from big tech corporations like Google and Microsoft, expanding their operations into more Asian and European countries, as members from these companies have cited their concerns of working with the US government over potential security and ethical conflicts.

This seems like another prime example of Trump not knowing how to properly govern. The executive order is largely symbolic and does not actually allocate any funds to the research and development of AI systems. The article talks about how Jim Mattis implored the White House to fund a military strategy to combat AI aggressors, and this executive order almost exclusively allocates resources towards the education of AI systems and technology on a national level. Trump largely chooses to govern without compromise and thinks he can create comprehensive policy using an Executive Order. In terms of the ethical questions, I'm not entirely sure Trump has the mental capacity to consider the complex moral and ethical questions about AI, autonomous weapons, and surveillance systems.
